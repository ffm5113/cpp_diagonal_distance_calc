# cpp_diagonal_distance_calc
The Diagonal Distance Calculator Program (C++) asks the user to enter a length, width, and height (space delimited). 

A function then passes the reference variables to a 2nd function, which calculates and displays the length of the longest possible diagonal distance from corner to corner of a rectangular room.

This example also demonstrates how variable aliases can be created with reference variables.
